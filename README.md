This is a simple metronome app that is created with React. It allows the user to change the BPM with a slider to stay on the beat. 
It plays in 4/4 time and the first beat of each measure is emphasized. It also has a nice popular anime background from "Your Lie in
April" to make staying on the beat a little bit nicer.
